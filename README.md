Gtk2Hs tutorial
===============
A set of lessons introducing Gtk2Hs, the Haskell binding to the Gtk2
library. The organization of the material and the code presented is based (so
far) on the book by Andrew Krause [Foundations of GTK+
development](http://www.gtkbook.com/home.php), which illustrates in depth the
original C version of GTK.
